- title: Our Food
  text: Our food is built on traditional family recipes, and takes inspiration from
    childhood experiences in the kitchen. Food always played an important role in
    family life and it’s about taking those early influences and injecting them in
    to our street food. All of our chicken is marinaded for 48 hours to ensure it’s
    super tender and tasty. Our chicken is then triple dipped in seasoned flour and
    our signature batters; ginger beer or cream soda. Once fried expect some serious
    flavour and crunch! If that wasn’t enough we have a selection of homemade sauces
    including our famous jerk gravy… plus jerk seasoned skin on fries and creamy slaw!
- title: Our Sound
  text: Only Jerkin' Sound System landed in spring 2018! Taking over venues from London
    to Birmingham, our events are about showcasing all that we love about Caribbean
    culture! Expect big flavours, big sounds and big smiles.

In 2016 the fried jerk chicken nugget in a ginger beer batter was born, our now signature and most popular dish. After a very positive response from feeding friends and family, we took to the streets of London, beginning our street food journey at Druid street market. You can now find our Caribbean fried chicken at Street Food Union in Soho and KERB markets across the capital every week, as well as our permanent unit in Camden
