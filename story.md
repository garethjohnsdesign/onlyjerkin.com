Polú Poké's story began in 2013 on a trip to Venice Beach in LA. Surfers, skaters and locals were queuing up for these delicious pots of marinated fish - flavours and colours like nothing I’d seen or tasted before back home.

In our first two years we’ve sold over twenty tonnes of cheese, and somewhere in the region of 100,000 grilled cheese sandwiches. We've been lucky enough to trade at a wide range of events, from the fields of Glastonbury to high profile fashion events for Alexander McQueen and even spent 6 weeks trading in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

The Cheese Truck is dedicated to celebrating the best of British cheese. We work closely with our producers, sourcing all our cheese direct from UK based farms that are making cheese in a traditional and thoughtful way.

Our aim is to share our food with as many people as possible, whilst informally educating them on how great British produce can be. All our dishes are accessible and affordable; we want everyone to have the opportunity to embrace them and be part of our British cheese revolution!

We’ll always keep our cooking simple and traditional to allow the superior quality of our produce to speak for itself.

We’ll only serve food we’re proud of and we’ll only ever serve food that puts a smile on your face!

Because, quite frankly, we love a smiley face…
